# JavaScript Xbox Game
Making an Xbox game with JavaScript

## Why
I wanted to make an Xbox game, but I didn't want to code my game in any language other than JavaScript (I would be writing it in TypeScript). I didn't want to use any game engine (which would probably make me use a language other than JavaScript).

## How it works
- I made a [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) with Visual Studio
- I added a web view to it, and the game is in the html displayed in the web view

## Playing
- Download Visual Studio and open this in Visual Studio
- Click run
